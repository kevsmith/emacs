This is my Emacs config. It is like no-one else's config. It is a special snowflake :-)

Installing:

1) git clone git://github.com/kevsmith/emacs.git

2) cd to the freshly cloned repo and run: git submodule init;git submodule update

3) Run the included Makefile. It will build distel's elisp and Erlang bits.

4) Add the environment variable $EMACS_CONFIG_ROOT to .bash_profile or similar file.
   It should point to the directory created in #1.

5) Drop these two lines in your ~/.emacs file to start using this config:

    ;; Path created in step #1
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs")
    (require 'my_config)
